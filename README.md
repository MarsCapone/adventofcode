# Advent of Code

Each directory is self-contained. Just `cd` in and run the files with python.

Any file can be run with an argument `test`, which looks for `{N}.test.txt` in the same directory as input.
If a file is not found, it will read from stdin instead.

Real test inputs can be saved as `{N}.txt`.
